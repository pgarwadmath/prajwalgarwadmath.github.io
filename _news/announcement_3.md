##### Secured 1st position in the <a href="https://www.sih.gov.in/" target="_blank">Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2023</a> under the Software Edition, organized by the <a href="https://www.education.gov.in/en" target="_blank">Ministry of Education, Government of India</a>.

We developed an innovative solution for real-time 3D reconstruction and preservation of heritage sites using SfM, NeRF, and 3D Gaussian Splatting. Showcased through immersive AR/VR experiences, the project addressed real-world challenges in defense and industrial applications requiring spatial awareness and high-fidelity visualization.
